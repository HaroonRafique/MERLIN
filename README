Building with gnu make
======================

In the merlin-unix directory. Edit the Makefile to set
MERLIN_INSTALL_DIR

Run:
make config
to generate the make files.

Run:
make
to build Merlin. The libmerlin.so library will be placed in MERLIN_INSTALL_DIR


Building with cmake
===================

Create a build directory, and cd into it.

To configure, run:
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release $PATH_TO_MERLIN_DIR
for example if you created the build directory inside the Merlin directory,
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

To interactivly configure, run:
ccmake $PATH_TO_MERLIN_DIR

To build run:
make
or, to build with multiple threads, e.g. 4 threads
make -j4


The libmerlin.so library will be built in the build directory.

Running Tests
=============

Enable tests with
cmake -DENABLE_TESTS=1

Then run:
make
make test
